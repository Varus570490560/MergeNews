With the anniversary of the Nintendo Switch's release approaching fast, we're pondering an important question: Is it the greatest Nintendo console ever? And if not, what is?

To answer this question, we're turning to the IGN community for help. Over the next month, we'll be hosting a continually updated bracket here on IGN, with fans able to vote on individual matchups. In the end, we'll crown the greatest Nintendo system ever, whether it's a traditional console or a handheld! 

We're in the finals right now, and it's two heavyweights going toe to toe for the ultimate prize, as decided by you.
The setup for this bracket is similar to the original (much better) format of the NFL playoffs. We've seeded individual consoles based on considerations including library, longevity, console design, and extras and seeded them accordingly. Here's how we seeded each bracket. The Super NES, NES, Game Boy, and Switch get a bye because they're just that good!

(1) Super Nintendo
(2) Nintendo Entertainment System
(3) GameCube
(4) Nintendo 64
(5) Nintendo Wii 
(6) Nintendo Wii U


(1) Game Boy
(2) Nintendo Switch
(3) Game Boy Advance (GBA) 
(4) Nintendo DS
(5) Nintendo 3DS
(6) Virtual Boy
