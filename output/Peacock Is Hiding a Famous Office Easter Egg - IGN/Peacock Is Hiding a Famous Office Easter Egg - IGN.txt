Every service you use has a lengthy user agreement, but who actually takes the time to read it? Well, NBC's Peacock user agreement has a fun easter egg from The Office hidden inside for anyone that scrolls through the whole thing.

As posted by TikTok user @mckenziefloyd and reported by People, a couple was scrolling through the streaming service's terms of service when they came across a recipe for Kevin Malone's chili from The Office. 
"I'm trying to figure out why the chili from The Office, the recipe is on here in the terms of conditions with the instructions," Floyd said in the TikTok post. "Why was that necessary to put on here? And then it just goes back to the regular terms and conditions."
If you watch the TikTok video, you can see the terms and conditions take a quick break to share Kevin's family recipe, from the ingredients to the steps to prepare it. If you're curious, here is the full recipe pulled from Peacock's website:
Ingredients
Directions
Kevin's chili appears in season 5, episode 26's cold open when the character gives a confessional all about his yearly tradition of bringing a pot of his famous chili to the office. Kevin says, "It's a recipe passed down by Malones for generations. It's probably the thing I do best." The cold open ends with Kevin dropping the pot, spilling chili all over the floor of the office.
