March 2022 is filled with a ton of new additions to Netflix, and one of its originals leading the way is The Adam Project with director Shawn Levy and star Ryan Reynolds. This film follows a time-traveling pilot who has to team up with his younger self and his late father to "come to terms with his past while saving the future."

Next month will also see the return of Bridgerton as its second season will premiere on March 25 and looks to have "duty, desire and scandal collide when viscount Anthony Bridgerton decides to marry, only to meet his match in his intended bride's headstrong big sister."
The fifth and final season of The Last Kingdom will be released on March 9, and the Big Mouth spin-off Human Resources will arrive on March 18 and will tell the stories of those creatures living inside of us, including Hormone Monsters, Depression Kitties, Shame Wizards, and more.
Movie fans will be happy to know that not only will Blade Runner 2049 and Dunkirk be joining Netflix's Library in March, but so will Shrek 1 & 2. Need we say more?
