Xbox Game Pass in August is already looking incredibly exciting. For starters. IGN's Game of the Year for 2020, Hades, is coming out on August 13 for Xbox, PS4, and PS5, and will hit Xbox Game Pass for consoles and PC on the same day. 

Not only that, but we've also got Humankind (PC) on August 17, Twelve Minutes on August 19, and Psychonauts 2 on August 25, which has been receiving some tremendous feedback after the recent previews. There's also Skate, Curse of the Dead Gods, Starmancer (Game Preview), and whole a lot more coming to Game Pass in August so far.
