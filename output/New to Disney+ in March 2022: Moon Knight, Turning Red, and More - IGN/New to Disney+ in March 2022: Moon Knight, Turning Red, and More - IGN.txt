The long-awaited arrival of Marvel's Moon Knight leads the way for March 2022's Disney+ additions. In this new MCU series, Oscar Isaac's Steven Grant becomes victim to blackouts and memories of other lives and he discovers he has "dissociative identity disorder and shares a body with mercenary Marc Spector."

March will also see Disney and Pixar's Turning Red join the service and tell the story of a 13-year-old who just so happens to "poof" into a giant red panda when she gets too excited. On the movie front, Steven Spielberg's West Side Story will become available to all Disney+ subscribers alongside a new take on Cheaper by the Dozen.
There will also be new episodes of The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder, a new treat for kids of all ages in The Wonderful Spring of Mickey Mouse, a look into the life and career of Olivia Rodrigo in OLIVIA RODRIGO: driving home 2 u, and much more.
