This deal just popped up this week over at Dell. Score an Alienware Aurora RTX 3070 equipped gaming PC for only $1499.99! It is easily capable of overpowering pretty much any game out there at up to 4K and is more than enough for 90% of gamers out there. For the select few who want consistent higher-than-60fps framerates at 4K, though, there's an even more powerful RTX 3080 equipped gaming PC that's also on sale.


This is the first time we've seen an Alienware Aurora gaming PC equipped with an RTX 3070 priced at under $1500. The RTX 3070 is even more powerful than the previous generation's fastest video card, the RTX 2080 Ti. This is the card to get if you want to push 144Hz frame rates or ultra high settings (or both) at up to 1440p. It's powerful enough to handle most 4K gaming as well. It's paired with some great specs, like a liquid cooled AMD Ryzen 7 5800 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD.

The RTX 3080 is the de facto card to get if you're gunning for 4K gaming. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 are the only cards that are (very slightly) more powerful, but they cost hundreds of dollars more. The RTX 3080 is paired with an AMD Ryzen 9 5900 CPU, which is one of the best processors you can get at the moment, whether it be for gaming or for workstation purposes. It's been upgraded with liquid cooling as well. The rig is ready to go out of the box with 16GB of DD4-3200MHz RAM and a generously sized 1TB M.2 PCIe NVME SSD. Don't worry, even the power supply is up to snuff with an ample 1000W rating.
Unceremoniously dubbed the "R13", Dell's new flagship gaming PC sports a number of aesthetic, quality of life, and performance improvements over its predecessors. In terms of future proofing, the Alienware Aurora R13 is the first Alienware PC to come equipped with the newest 12th gen Intel Alder Lake processors. That's paired with a Z690 based motherboard that accepts DDR5 RAM. This proves that DDR5 RAM actually exists in the wild. Your video card options are great as well; pick your choice of RTX 30 series video card, from the RTX 3060 Ti all the way to the RTX 3090, at your expense of course. Perhaps the best news? According to Dell's website, these configs ship out in early March.
