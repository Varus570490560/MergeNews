Dell is one of best brands we'd recommend if you're looking to get a prebuilt gaming PC. The Alienware gaming desktops offer a staggering array of options, all built into a custom chassis that's both easy on the eyes and easy on the wallet. Alienware gaming laptops have been redesigned to be thinner and lighter while still offering the same immense power under the hood. For those of you on a budget, Dell also offers its Dell G-series gaming desktops and laptops. You still get to customize it to your heart's content, but at a much lower price point. If you're not looking for a gaming rig, the XPS laptop is perfect for the road warrior, and the Inspirons are great for students.

The reliable build quality, available inventory, frequent sales, and solid customer service are the main reasons why Dell is at the top of our buying list.

This is the first time we've seen an Alienware Aurora gaming PC equipped with an RTX 3070 priced at under $1500. The RTX 3070 is even more powerful than the previous generation's fastest video card, the RTX 2080 Ti. This is the card to get if you want to push 144Hz frame rates or ultra high settings (or both) at up to 1440p. It's powerful enough to handle most 4K gaming as well. It's paired with some great specs, like a liquid cooled AMD Ryzen 7 5800 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD.

The RTX 3080 is the de facto card to get if you're gunning for 4K gaming. The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 are the only cards that are (very slightly) more powerful, but they cost hundreds of dollars more. The RTX 3080 is paired with an AMD Ryzen 9 5900 CPU, which is one of the best processors you can get at the moment, whether it be for gaming or for workstation purposes. It's been upgraded with liquid cooling as well. The rig is ready to go out of the box with 16GB of DD4-3200MHz RAM and a generously sized 1TB M.2 PCIe NVME SSD. Don't worry, even the power supply is up to snuff with an ample 1000W rating.

Dell is offering the Xbox Series S gaming console (which comes with one wireless controller) bundled with a second Xbox wireless controller for only $327.99. That's basically paying $28 for that second controller. Considering the Robot White controller normally runs about $60, that's a great deal if you were planning to pick up a second controller anyways.
Unceremoniously dubbed the "R13", Dell's new flagship gaming PC sports a number of aesthetic, quality of life, and performance improvements over its predecessors. In terms of future proofing, the Alienware Aurora R13 is the first Alienware PC to come equipped with the newest 12th gen Intel Alder Lake processors. That's paired with a Z690 based motherboard that accepts DDR5 RAM. This proves that DDR5 RAM actually exists in the wild. Your video card options are great as well; pick your choice of RTX 30 series video card, from the RTX 3060 Ti all the way to the RTX 3090, at your expense of course. Perhaps the best news? According to Dell's website, these configs ship out end of February.

Until recently, Dell's only PC option that offered an Intel Alder Lake CPU, DDR5 RAM, and RTX 30 series video cards was in the form of the Alienware Aurora R13 gaming PC listed above. At a cost of about $2900 for an Intel Core i7 RTX 3080 combo, it's out of reach for many people. Now, Dell has extended similar buildout options to its new 2021-2022 Dell XPS gaming PC. Compared to the previous model, the new Dell XPS chassis is larger in volume (27L vs 19L) and provides more clearance for the CPU and GPU area for much better airflow. That's important because the new Alder Lake processors can run hot under intense loads. Like the Alienware Aurora R13, the new Dell XPS PC features a Z690 motherboard that supports the newest 12th gen Intel Alder Lake processors, DDR5 RAM, and RTX 30 series video cards over PCI-E 5.0. These configs should also ship in early February.

Dell has launched two new Alienware laptops for 2021, the 15" X15 and the 17" X17. They succeed the m15 and m17 as Alienware's flagship gaming laptops. They also happen to be the thinnest Alienware laptops ever despite the fact that they're equipped with the next generation RTX 30 series video cards. In fact, they are thinner than the "ultra-thin" Razer Blade 15" laptop. The X15 model measures in at only 0.63" thin and 5.2 pounds and the X17 model is 0.84" thin and 7.05 pounds. The laptops also feature the newest Intel 11th gen H-series processors and a powerful quadruple fan active cooling system that keeps all the components nice and cool.
